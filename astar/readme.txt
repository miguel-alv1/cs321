Timing Measurements:

A* Manhattan Distance Total Time (in seconds):
0.26349377632141113

A* Num Wrong Tiles Total Time (in seconds):
4.816094160079956

Total Time for both heuristics (in seconds):
5.080

--------------------------------------------

When comparing this to iterative deepening, the total time for a single
run of depth 16 is ~340 seconds which is much slower than both runs of 
Manhattan distance and Num wrong tiles using A* which took only ~5
seconds altogether.
